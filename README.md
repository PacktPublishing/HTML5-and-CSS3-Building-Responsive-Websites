* Use Bower to organize website dependencies
* Make responsive media that is optimized for the specific device on which it’s displayed, allowing images, videos, and other elements be fully appreciated
* Make typography that’s fluidly responsive, so it’s easy to read on all devices—no more hard-to-see text on a tiny mobile screen
* Get to know techniques for server-side and client-side media deployment, providing platforms that are scaled for any device that requests them
